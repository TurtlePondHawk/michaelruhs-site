<h1>Structural Risk Brief — FAQ</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Clarification of scope, process, and positioning.</p>

<hr>

<h3>What exactly is the Structural Risk Brief?</h3>
<p>
A document-based structural exposure assessment of referral concentration and Medicare Advantage dependency within your revenue model. It evaluates sensitivity under modest stress assumptions and identifies stabilization priorities.
</p>

<h3>Is this a strategy or consulting engagement?</h3>
<p>
No. The Brief is a contained structural analysis. It does not redesign operations, negotiate contracts, or provide ongoing advisory services.
</p>

<h3>Why is there no introductory call?</h3>
<p>
The Brief is designed to be document-driven. The required submission data is sufficient to model structural exposure. Clarifications, if needed, are handled via email to preserve analytical efficiency.
</p>

<h3>Why is payment required upfront?</h3>
<p>
The Brief involves allocated modeling time. Work begins upon receipt of payment and is non-refundable once analysis starts.
</p>

<h3>How long is the Brief?</h3>
<p>
Typically 6–10 pages depending on structural complexity. It is concise and focused rather than expansive.
</p>

<h3>What inputs are required?</h3>
<p>
• Five Snapshot section scores<br>
• Top 2 referral percentages<br>
• Top 3 referral percentages<br>
• Largest Medicare Advantage percentage<br>
• Approximate annual revenue<br>
• One sentence describing your primary structural concern
</p>

<h3>How is this different from what a CPA or internal analyst would review?</h3>
<p>
CPAs evaluate historical performance. Internal analysts often assess volume and margin trends. The Structural Risk Brief models dependency sensitivity and leverage exposure under structural change.
</p>

<h3>Is this confidential?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Submitted information is treated confidentially and used solely for the modeling exercise.
