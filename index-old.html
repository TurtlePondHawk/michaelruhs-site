  <h1>Preferred Partner Readiness Snapshot</h1>
  <p> This Snapshot is designed to be completed privately by the skilled home care agency owner or administrator.
There are no right answers. It works best when you answer conservatively.
If you’re unsure whether something would hold up consistently with referral sources or payors, mark “No.”
All questions are required.

    <!-- Dimension 1: Positioning Clarity -->
    <section class="dim" id="dim1">
      <h2>Dimension 1. Positioning Clarity</h2>
      <p>This dimension looks at whether your agency has a clear, defensible position in the minds of referral partners and payors. Strong agencies are not just “good.” They are distinct. Weak positioning shows up when partners struggle to explain why they refer to you, default to habit, or treat you as interchangeable. If this area is weak, preference erodes quietly even when performance is solid.</p>

      <div class="q">
        <strong>Dimension 1, Q1:</strong>
        <span>If a referral partner were asked what differentiates your agency, would they give a specific, consistent answer without prompting?</span>

      <h2>Dimension 2. Proof and Credibility</h2>
      <p>This dimension assesses whether your strengths are verifiable and portable, not just believed internally.

Agencies with strong proof rely on evidence that travels without them.</p>

      <h2>Dimension 3. Referral and Payor Dependence</h2>
      <p>This dimension evaluates how exposed your agency is to concentration risk and invisible behavior shifts. High dependence often feels stable until it isn’t. The risk is not losing a source suddenly. The risk is not seeing preference decay until it impacts operations. Agencies with resilience understand why they are chosen and actively reinforce those reasons before volume changes.</p>

        <p>How to score your Snapshot</p>
        <p>Each section contains four Yes or No questions. Each section scores from 0 to 4. Don't combine sections or calculate an overall score. Each dimension stands on its own.
<p>What this Snapshot is actually telling you<p>
        This Snapshot isn't measuring effort or intent. It reflects how your agency likely appears when you are not in the room. The questions are designed to mirror how referral partners and payors quietly evaluate: - clarity - credibility - dependence risk - operational signal. Strong internal performance does not always translate to external preference. This Snapshot is meant to surface that gap.</p>
        <p><strong>How to interpret your scores</strong></p>
        <p>0–1: High risk. This area likely weakens your position on paper, even if day-to-day operations feel stable.</p>
		<p>2–3: Mixed. This is where preference often erodes quietly over time.</p>
		<p>4: Relative strength. Less likely to be the reason you are deprioritized. 
		<p>Pay particular attention to any section that scored 2 or below. That is usually where hidden leverage or exposure lives.</p>
        <p><strong>What to do next</strong></p>
        <p>If all sections scored 3 or 4, your agency likely presents as stable and credible to outside decision-makers. Maintain this deliberately. If one or more sections scored 2 or below, do not ignore it. These are not abstract risks. They directly affect: - referral behavior - payor confidence - long-term defensibility.</p>
        <p>Small gaps in how you are perceived tend to compound before they become visible internally.</p>
        <h4>If you want a second set of eyes</h4>
        <p>If you’d like, you can send me an email at <a href="mailto:michael@michaelruhs.com?subject=Snapshot Question">Email Michael</a> with:
        <ul><li>your four section scores</li><li>one sentence on what surprised you</li></ul>
        I’ll send back a short set of prioritized actions based on where exposure typically shows up first. No obligation. Just guidance.</p>
        <h4>Final Note</h4>
        <p>This Snapshot is not trivial. This is your business, and it reflects how the partners and customers you depend on likely see you when making real decisions. Treat it with the same seriousness they do.</p>`;
